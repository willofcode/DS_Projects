download and check c++ --version
if you are using macOS or linux, you will need a package manager preferably homebrew to install built-in compilers and additional software

to compile the program you will need to access the folder and access the file.
- gcc/ g++ -o 'theexecutable' theprogram.cpp
- this will create an executable and .o file
- to run the executable you will need to run on terminal ./'theexecutable'

note: multiple .cpp can be compiled together under one 'executable'
